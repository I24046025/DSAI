Two notebooks are contained in this assignment:
* [Addition](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/frank11158/DSAI/blob/master/hw2/Addition.ipynb)
* [Discussion](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/frank11158/DSAI/blob/master/hw2/Discussion.ipynb)

The **Addition** notebook presents the details of how data are generated and how models are built and trained with example of an Adder.
The **Discussion** notebook presents comparasions and discussions of adder, subtractor, and adder+subtractor models with different training conditions.
